A React Project to display my portfolio and resume

## Thought process behind portfolio website

My old website, which is currently stored in the branch "Old-HTML-Project", was based off of a basic HTML layout. Although the website was functional, I wanted to add some routing functionality in the event where I would need it in the future. To accomplish, I transitioned to the React Framework, using create-react-app, and worked on improving some of the pain-points on the old website. These include:
 - Too many elements to look at once
 - Use of anchors rather than button-like elements
 - Unusual colour choices (similar colour choices to the current website, but anchor and hover colours did not complement other elements)
 - A useless projects section (this is currently hosted on Notion, but may be built into the main project in the future)
 - Have proper links to LinkedIn and GitHub

Transitioning to React enables other functionality to be built into the future, such as:
 - Creating a blog/journal website (I have already started working on this project, using FireBase and React)
 - Creating a dedicated projects section (This is currently hosted on Notion, as tagging and hyperlinks are easier to manage here)
 - Creating a dark mode
 - Creating animations using three js
